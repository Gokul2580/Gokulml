EXP NO:1 IMPLEMENTATION OF FIND-S ALGORITHM
DATE:
AIM:
To implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific
hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples.
ALGORITHM:
1. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
2. For each positive training instance x
For each attribute constraint ai in h
If the constraint ai is satisfied by x
Then do nothing
Else replace ai in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied
by x
3. Output hypothesis h
Training Sample:
Example Sky AirTemp Humidity Wind Water Forecast EnjoySport
1 sunny warm normal strong warm same yes
2 sunny warm high strong warm same yes
3 rainy cold high strong warm change no
4 sunny warm high strong cool change yes

PROGRAM:

import csv
a = []
with open('enjoysport.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
 for row in csv.reader(csvfile):
 a.append(row)
 print(a)
print("\n The total number of training instances are : ",len(a))
num_attribute = len(a[0])-1
print("\n The initial hypothesis is : ")
hypothesis = ['0']*num_attribute
print(hypothesis)
for i in range(0, len(a)):
 if a[i][num_attribute] == 'yes':
 for j in range(0, num_attribute):
 if hypothesis[j] == '0' or hypothesis[j] == a[i][j]:
 hypothesis[j] = a[i][j]
 else:
 hypothesis[j] = '?'
 print("\n The hypothesis for the training instance {} is : \n" .format(i+1),hypothesis)
print("\n The Maximally specific hypothesis for the training instance is ")
print(hypothesis)

OUTPUT:
The Given Training Data Set
['sunny', 'warm', 'normal', 'strong', 'warm', 'same', 'yes']
['sunny', 'warm', 'high', 'strong', 'warm', 'same', 'yes']
['rainy', 'cold', 'high', 'strong', 'warm', 'change', 'no']
['sunny', 'warm', 'high', 'strong', 'cool', 'change', 'yes']
The total number of training instances are : 4
The initial hypothesis is :
['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
The hypothesis for the training instance 1 is :
['sunny', 'warm', 'normal', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
The hypothesis for the training instance 2 is :
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
The hypothesis for the training instance 3 is :
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', 'warm', 'same']
The hypothesis for the training instance 4 is :
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']
The Maximally specific hypothesis for the training instance is
['sunny', 'warm', '?', 'strong', '?', '?']
RESULT:
Thus the program for Find S algorithm with a training dataset was implemented and
executed successfully.
