I feel very good about these beers  
This is my best work 
What an awesome view 
I do not like this restaurant  
I am tired of this stuff  
I can't deal with this 
Program: 
import pandas as pd 
msg=pd.read_csv('naivetext.csv',names=['message','label']) 
print('The dimensions of the dataset',msg.shape) 
msg['labelnum']=msg.label.map({'pos':1,'neg':0}) 
X=msg.message 
y=msg.labelnum 
print(X)

#splitting the dataset into train and test data 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
xtrain,xtest,ytrain,ytest=train_test_split(X,y) 
print ('\n the total number of Training Data :',ytrain.shape) 
print ('\n the total number of Test Data :',ytest.shape) 
# output of the words or Tokens in the text documents 
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer 
count_vect = CountVectorizer() 
xtrain_dtm = count_vect.fit_transform(xtrain) 
xtest_dtm=count_vect.transform(xtest) 
# Training Naive Bayes (NB) classifier on training data. 
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB 
clf = MultinomialNB().fit(xtrain_dtm,ytrain) 
predicted = clf.predict(xtest_dtm) 
#printing accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision and Recall 
from sklearn import metrics 
print('\n Accuracy of the classifier is',metrics.accuracy_score(ytest,predicted)) 
print('\n Confusion matrix') 
print(metrics.confusion_matrix(ytest,predicted)) 
print('\n The value of Precision', metrics.precision_score(ytest,predicted)) 
print('\n The value of Recall', metrics.recall_score(ytest,predicted))

Result: 
Thus, the naïve Bayesian Classifier model to classify a set of documents is 
implemented and the accuracy, precision, and recall are measured.
